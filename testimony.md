# A Personal Witness and Testimony

## abstract

This is the written account of my personal witness and testimony. If you are not sure what that is, I will take a quick paragraph right here to explain it. Though we may be born into the world with an innate innocence, we are not with innate awareness of God. A *witness and testimony* is just what it sounds like. If someone were to be a witness and give a testimony in a court trial proving the sovereign, existence, and majesty of God,  the contents of that testimony would be ... well a testimony. That's pretty much what this is. Imagine through your life, God has been obvious and present therein and exposed to you convincing you of His existence. The cumulative description of those events is what would be your testimony. This is mine.

It may at times sound like an autobiography; however, an autobiography is entirely self-serving. This is not. I am merely a supporting role in this. I am a witness describing what he sees as he sees it. The main focus here is God. 

## The Catholic Church

I cannot recall my first encounter with God. The furthest I can recall is that I was raised Catholic by Catholic parents and grandparents. Most of that time I had no idea what that meant though. It is not something that was ever explained or taught to me. I learned it through osmosis. I did not know who Jesus was or His importance until a fateful day when I would use His name swearing by it. My father then did something completely unexpected. He scolded me like I had never been scolded before in my life. 

I like to think I knew my father pretty well. I knew what was important to him and where his convictions were. At least, I thought I did. His convictions were:

1. Honesty
1. Hard work
1. Integrity
1. Generosity
1. Competition
1. Winning
1. Quality

That day, I learned there was one very close to the top that he had tucked away as if to protect it from being damaged or broken. Jesus. The conviction that was the foundation/cornerstone of all his other convictions and without which would cause this man to crumble into oblivion as if he never were. In that moment, it was made very clear to me just who Jesus was ... to my father.

I still did not know who Jesus was, but now I knew that in our house, we revered Him for what little I knew of Him. At this point in my life, I began to take prayer seriously. This is important because it opened my mind to Jesus and this open mind would later lead me to search for him fervently.

## School

School is a subject of embarrassment for most. I was not immune. In my youth, I (in my ignorance) lashed out at God and Jesus. I cursed Him, challenged His authority, and criticized His followers at every turn. Whenever I encountered a Christian, I took it as an opportunity to belittle and insult them for dismissing science in favor of faith and insisting that Christians are a burden on the rest of us logical and rational thinkers.

The embarrassment on my part was the acts I would carry out and the words I would use to prove my point. While it might add to the testimony to illustrate just what I said and did, I cannot repeat those events. Call it my own shortcoming for being unable to. I am sorry. In my opinion, it is enough to know that my actions were enough to shame me into never describing it again.

### Johnny

This does not mean I have no redeeming or noteworthy experiences from that period that will add value to my testimony. Of those, I have an abundant number. Do not be troubled.

I will start with Johnny. First, I need to establish the setting. Johnny was the first to notice what I was doing to myself and others as I foolishly exclaimed my disdain for Christianity. At this time, I was going to school. I was taking classes at a Community College (Junior College or 2-year degree program). I was also living with my parents (my very hardworking parents that were working two jobs each and my father had already retired once). Needless to say, they had no time or finances to assist me with high school or my progress through adolescence. To add more fuel to the fire, I was not alone. I had an older twin-brother. At 13 years of age, my parents walked us through the paperwork of enrolling into a Community College as full-time students. It was then, that our journey to adult maturity would begin and our high school days were gone in the blink of an eye.

It was in this place that my new doctrine would be nurtured. It was an anti-Christ/anti-Western doctrine. I drank the kool-aid.  Finally, the acceptance I had been trying to achieve most of my life was within my grasp. All I needed was to publicly through Jesus under the bus.

He just could not take it any longer. This arrogant kid that insulted and abused the name of his savior again and again. Something had to be done. That is when Johnny introduced himself. I had seen him many times with a girl I assumed was his girlfriend (or maybe his sister?) logging into terminals in the computer lab. For the most part, I was an extreme introvert. For most, I would not register as a life form in the room. The only time I really came alive was when my assistance was needed in the battle against Jesus. I would rise to the occasion vehemently each time. As I had stated, this just would not do for Johnny. The fallacies that would spew forth were just too much. Looking back, I do not remember much of what I was saying, but I feel it in my gut that it was crazy talk because later Johnny would set me straight on so many things.

It can be recalled that even while I may be going through a period of defiance against Jesus, I am still open to Him. For this reason, I am somehow open-minded when listening as Johnny depends his perspective and Jesus as his savior. Most of his points (I admit) are straight from a witnessing manual. He asks questions like:

* What do you think happens after you die?
* What if you're wrong?
* What does compassion and mercy mean to you?
* Do you think everyone deserves compassion and mercy?

As I was answering, I listened to the answers I was giving to these questions and I felt unsatisfied and unfulfilled. At times, I felt like I did not know the person answering the questions. It was not me. It was not the person I wanted to be. I began to have questions about the way I was living my life and who I was living for. I began to understand that my life was not about me. It was about others. I did not yet yield the reigns over to Jesus. I did not yet agree with Johnny even. Johnny would come to speak with me and ask the same questions many times. My pride would not let me agree once. Later, he would graduate and move on, but his influence would leave me to question my own purpose.

### Emil

I like to feel like everyone goes through an extremely self-destructive phase in their lives. Well, maybe not everyone, but close to a lot of people. That is how I rationalize this period of my life as still a little bit normal. 

At this point in my life, I am approximately 15 years old. Originally, I considered pursuing a career in engineering; however, my experience in school pushed me closer toward software and computer programming. At this point, the internet officially exists as *the internet*. Just recently, it was called *the information superhighway* and **arpanet**. There is an increasing demand of those knowledgable in TCP/IP, HTML, CGI, unix, and (oddly) mainframe systems. I started diving into all at once and my local computer lab was the best place to start. Our terminals were VAX/Vms terminals with **kermit** that allowed me to dial into any other system on the network. This includes our Unix and Linux systems. Basically, from the computer lab, I could self-teach myself anything and I did. I spent a great deal of time there.

I started taking classes in the CS program at the college. While I was not a lab employee, I spent so much time there (approximately 10 hours/day), people often asked me for help and I was more than willing to give it. Everyone likes to be noticed, even if it is for being a fixture.

This is important because my life is very much different now than it had been. I was still angry toward Christians and Jesus, but now I kept it directed more inward as I dealt with the conflict internally. My new-found interest in the internet was causing some outward changes. It gave me a conduit for communication with the world. I was extremely socially inept. The only way I could really communicate with others was through a keyboard. I soon attached myself to MUD/MOO/MUCK/MUSH/BBS systems. Ironically, many of these systems I would login to and interact with people that were actually just a few feet away from me. I could actually just strike a conversation with these people, but instead I chose to interact with them in a much less personal way. I was allowed to interact (role-playing) with other individuals. Of course, it was just gaming; however, in many cases you share ideas. There are actual conversations that take place with the usual water-cooler talk. Some of it got pretty personal and some of them even very intimate. The reader needs to understand that it was not uncommon to witness (in text and on screen) extremely lewd acts. Thinking back, it's a wonder that my parents let me into this place. Oh wait, they did not know. 

At one point, I found myself in an epic battle for dominion over Midgaard. I released a relentless chain lightning spell at a pack of bandits near a jackosquidalope (do not ask) when suddenly a shriek came from someone next to me, "That was my jackosquidalope! You jerk! You just stole my kill!" Of course, this person did not know it was me that did it. This outburst earned him a visit from one of the lab aids to instruct him not to disrupt others trying to use the lab for educational endeavors. I later apologized and introduced myself, but this was the beginning of one of the most self-destructive periods of my life. His name was Emil, and together we would game for hours and hours over the course of the next year or so. Further than that, I would (through him), recruit others into our self-destructive ways. Just how self-destructive are we talking? Like this:

* Skipping classes (not just a few) to game and raid
* Disruptive yelling (to the point where we were regularly kicked out of labs)
* Encouraged insecurity (we literally fed off each others insecurities and nurtured their growth)
* Poor hygiene
* I began a diet of only Jolt Cola and chocolate brownies for an entire year
* In general, really messed up priorities

Beyond this, my attitude toward life had changed. Some would say I started thinking life was a game and that I could just get more lives so who cared? I say that because I actually heard people saying it. Here is my own personal analysis after reflection: 
* I did not have many/any friends. Emil was really the first person I regular spoke to during my higher education career. We were on friendly terms and had a vested interest in each other's going ons, so I guess you could say we were friends in an acceptable use for the word. We were hookey friends, but not real friends.
* I started to be concerned with questions like "Am I a contributing member of society?", "Would the world be better off without me?", "Am I ever going to get a girlfriend?", "Does it matter if I'm likeable?", and there are others. I asked myself the kinds of questions that would inevitably lead a person to a dark place. Let us just call this depression. 
* Maybe it was just my age, but I like to also think that the problems I had been working through at the time coupled with anger towards my parents and in general (I had anger issues) allowed me to resent and event disrespect authority of all types.
* Again, maybe it was just my age, but I began to be concerned about my outward appearance as well and I attempted to make changes. Most people would just go to the gym or exercise more. I actually made life changes. I decided that my appearance needed wardrobe changes, changes in culture including people I associated with, and also activities I engaged in. Sounds weird and I am not really sure how I arrived at this, but there it is.

Let us now add up the analysis. Lack for friends, depression, defiance of authority, and life changes to improve my appearance led me down a very self-destructive path. I stopped caring about right and wrong, what people thought about me, what my future was going to be like (I assumed there just was not going to be one), and worst of all other people. It all just did not matter anymore.

These feelings really took my relationship with Emil into the worst possible growth. I did not care that I missed classes and my grades were circling the drain. I did not care that I was going to lose my grant funding for my education. It did not matter to me that I was making it difficult for others to get their education. I was a nuisance and disrespectful to lab employees. Something had to be done only it was not me that was going to do anything about it. Lab personnel had been made aware of me. They were asked to refuse me access to systems due to my abuse. 

One would normally get the hint and try to turn around their behavior, but I was journeying down a self-destructive path. I was determined to destroy everything I knew. I could not gain access to labs, so I started going to libraries. Libraries used the same mainframe and were connected to the same network. I started using card catalog terminals to play games from and connect with people. Eventually, library staff became suspicious of the guy that only ever looked at the card catalog and never checked out books. Lab staff finally alerted library staff and I was ejected from the library. I had not hit the bottom yet, but this was pretty bad. 

How does one find God amidst their own destruction? When I look back, I see He was there the whole time. I must have been difficult to watch, but in hindsight I can recall several minor miracles that helped me through it. Imagine that as low as I now am, I cannot print homework, use local facilities, inquire on books from the library (or even enter the library), or even check status of my grades or courses. All this and my financial aid was taken from me, so the worst of my problems was still enrollment. Regarding my own education, I am deaf, blind, mute, and hog-tied. Yet still, God provided a way for me to accomplish all the things I needed. I found financing. When the U.S. government had turned its back on me, God had not. He showed me the way. There was nothing I could do for my grades, but I continued. I struggled. I persevered. God was my way through each time. When I needed a way to school or home, God was there when my parents could not. When my own competence failed me and I needed to reason with the most unreasonable of instructors, God was there. When I was down to my last penny and had no food, friends, family, or anything, God was there. Every impossible situation I found myself in, God provided me a way out. Just as any teenager, at the time, I did not see what my Father had done for me.

### Fred

It can be recalled that I mentioned some life changes I made in order to address self-image problems I was working through. I decided that I needed to be more athletic, wear more trendy clothes, and spend time with a trendy crowd. I could answer all these questions at once by choosing the right activity. I went with skating. It was pretty easy because at my age, that is what most kids were doing. I decided I had to be different though. I did not like skateboards, so I went with in-line skates. I decided that whatever hate and backlash came as a result, I would take it all on in defiance of the status quo.

I just needed to buy a few things:
* Hardware
* Clothes
* Gear

Ok. I have all the stuff, now what? Practice. I dove in head-first. I got everything I could find on what and how to's of aggressive in-line skating. Day in and day out I practiced and conditioned my body to do flips, spins, jumps. I threw myself at curbs, rails, stairs, and jumped impossible heights. I was going through self-destructive phase, so it was really perfect. A person with no regard for their own safety could easily learn extreme sports. 

After months, of preparing myself for the world of aggresive in-line skating, I went out. The next part of the plan was to interact with a trendy crowd. I knew there were others like me, I just needed to find them. It was not hard. At the time, I live in place where skate parks are non-existent. The only places to skate are basically schools. This fed right into my defiance for authority because school security was very much against skating of any kind. 

The trouble is I am an introvert. This makes interacting with a crowd virtually impossible. Lucky for me, I ran into Fred. He was about my age, and he had been skating just about as long. We were noobs. Neither one of us knew what we were doing, so we decided to learn together. If skating fed my defiance for authority, Fred was the kool-aid that washed it all down. He was like me only several tiers above. Around Fred, my anger, defiance, hate went to really unhealthy levels. 

> **Note** This makes it sound like I regret Fred, but I do not. He was one of my best friends. If this were my autobiography, it would read differently. This is my testimony though and as far as my relationship with God goes, Fred was very unhealthy for me.

I did things that tested God's patience for me. I challenged the world, but not in a way that is like "Ha world! You don't like me, I'll show you just how good I am." No. I challenged the world like, "Hey world! I am going to destroy you and cause you to crumble because I hate you and I don't care how many people have to suffere before I'm satisfied." I got myself into mess after mess and God had to bail me out again and again. I was nearly (I have no idea how I was not) arrested on many occasions. 

In spite of all the wrong I had committed, Fred did more than just fuel my self-destruction. Fred was a double-edged sword. He also fueled my knowledge for operating systems and hacking. Fred was very much interested in pirated software (again, bad) and Linux. I can see how God needed us to influence each other for better or worse. The ideal situation would have been that we'd be positive influences on each other, but we were both negative and positive. One of my greatest regrets is that had I accepted God sooner, maybe things would have turned out differently for us. 

### Andrea

At 17 years of age, I just started to recover from my self-destructive phase. At this point, I had some real near-misses that resulted in some serious reality checks. Still not seeing God, but at least I am not overtly trying to put myself in harms way. Through my recovery, I managed to regain access to computer labs. That was not all that was different. I was different. I had changed. I was in control of my life again. That meant that I was not a nuissance in the lab, skipping classes, gaming on the network, or disrespectful to lab staff. I volunteered in the lab, I had been teaching myself to program VAX/Vms assembly and a few other languages. Much of my spare time was in writing utilities for maintaining the network and even communicate with other users. I shared the software and its source code freely and through it I gained a sense of purpose that only drove me to do it more. I encountered a lot of people in the labs and I even began to work on my social skills. Eventually, I was having regular conversations and interactions with people, but the network is still where I was most comfortable.

At some point I started a conversation with a user on the network. She later informed me that we had actually met several times in passing in the lab. She knew exactly who I was, but I had no idea who she was. After some time had passed, I soon learned who I had been talking to. This was the start of a friendship that would last a lifetime (or at least I hope). 

Our conversations would last hours and I would open up in a way I never had to anyone. I told her everything. It was as if after enduring a lifetime of interrogation tactics, I decided I had enough and now I will confess what I have been hiding. My confessions seemed never ending, and I never wanted them to.

Andrea is a pastor's daughter. Over the course of our relationship, I exclaimed to her (to my great shame and embarrassment) many times about my dislike for Jesus, Christians, Christianity, churches, and religion in general. She did not sound or react angrily, but I could sense that she was very much annoyed with my ignorant views. Her responses were simply to witness to me.

> **Note**: for those of you that do not know what a witness (not steem witness LOL) is, it is in reference to a witness for a prosecuting case where one gives testimony on behalf of an argument. Andrea would give testimony to me as a witness for who God is.

She did this countless times. One day, I realized that something needed to change for my own sake. Prior to this point, changes that turned my life toward improvements were my own revelations that a life of selfless generosity was the way to go. I had adopted the philosophy that putting the needs of others before my own would somehow attribute meaning in my life. It was at this time that I realized that I was still empty and living this way would not give me life at all. I talked this through with Andrea and I began to read the Bible. Even though I had not accepted God or Jesus, I prayed with her. My life started to change in ways I cannot explain.

I then faced a new revelation (not Biblical). My life is not my own. What gives my life meaning is not that I should live for others, but for one (not me). 

> **[Romans 6:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6:22&version=KJV)** But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

The emptiness I felt could be filled by love from God and that he has a plan for me. 

> **[Jeremiah 29:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jeremiah+29.11&version=ESV)** For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare[a] and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.

I learned that I am indeed special. I am not like the others and it's purposely this way. 

> **[Psalm 139:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139%3A14&version=ESV)** I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.[a] Wonderful are your works my soul knows it very well.

I also learned to deal with the anger inside me.

> **[Psalm 30:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+30:5&version=ESV)** For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime.[a] Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning.

I realized that I had been ignorant. I still did not regard the Bible as truth yet, but I did acknowledge my understanding of it and Jesus was severely limited. I had been living a lie. I was angry at people and did not even know why or for what reason. My prejudice had become so clear that there was nothing left but my own shame. It was not enough to learn by reading. I needed a real teacher. I needed someone to explain in an objective way. I needed to draw my own conclusions. The solution was to enroll in classes on religion and theology.

### Divorce

So what ever did happen with my parents while my life was a wobbling top on a jagged incline? They divorced. Struggling bills, debts, employment, and other things took their toll. After 17 years, even my parents could not make a long distance relationship work. Proof enough for me to never get involved in one. My father was the one that opened precedings. My mother fought it with everything she could. At this point, I had confessed to God that my life was in His hands now and that I had accepted His son as my Lord and Savior. Things seemed as though my life had reached an apex. Instead, God was there when I would lean on Him the most. The divorce was difficult for my mother and I came to realize that she needed me. She could not do it alone and God had planned this. His plan for me was that I would be the support she needed.

#### Bi-Polar Disorder

There were times I though that I had failed my mother. This was especially the case with her first attempted suicide. My mother had battled a smoking habit most of her life. After her divorce, she decided that it was time that habit ended abruptly. She quit cold turkey. I did not even know she had until one day she told me she quit. Later, I learned how when she had run her vehicle off the road during an attempted suicide. Following her accident, she checked herself into a mental health clinic and was diagnosed with [bi-polar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder). 

> **Note** Those that do not know what [bi-polar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) is, it is a disorder also known as manic depression. This literally means for a person to abruptly switch between mania and depression. Mania is mostly compulsive behavior where the afflicted has very little control over his/her actions. In many cases, it can lead to suicide attempts.

My mother's life had changed again. After one monumental change, another has come. I thought to myself, "Why?! Why her? What did she do to deserve this?" I realized, I was asking the wrong question. The answer was the same as before. This was coming no matter what and God had been preparing me for it because I was intended to be here for my mother. God was not responsible for what happened to her either time. He still loved her and did not forsake her. He prepared for her a way through it just like he had done for me. Her partner had left her, but she would not be alone.

#### Homeless

Unfortunately, my mother's illness took her out of work and left our family on the edge of ruin and destitution. I had to move out, but had nowhere to move to. This was extremely abrupt and unplanned. At first, I stayed in my family home (it is now foreclosed by the bank) until I could find other accommodations. Things had moved so quickly that there was no time. I found myself moving from temporary location to temporary location as things gradually became worse. Among some of the places I would spend the night:
* A stranger's couch
* Coworker's floor
* Public bathroom stall
* Stairwell at school
* Under a bridge (my father did say one day I would end up living under a bridge).
* Behind a wall (that was it. Just a wall.)
* Andrea's church

I stank. I had hit the bottom. Things could not possibly get worse. I asked God again why this needed to be. I asked if I was being punished. I just did not understand what it all meant. If God had a purpose for me, was it so that I could endure this? Was all this a trial to make me more humble and better? I could accept it all if I just understood. That is faith though. 

> **[Hebrews 11:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A1&version=ESV)** Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.

Faith is not about knowing. Faith is about being completely uncertain and carrying forth regardless. I realized that is what I needed to do. This was a change that would stay with me the rest of my life. In this moment, I grew and changed in a way I never had before. From this point, no adversity would shake my resolve again. I would never waver in the face of uncertainty. I knew because the proof was my life. What I had overcome with God showed me that I will never know a day without Him, and that my only need is for His acceptance.

> **[Proverbs 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3:5&version=ESV)** Trust in the Lord with all your heart,  and do not lean on your own understanding.

> **[Matthew 6:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:33&version=ESV)** But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

I knew that if I stayed focused on what God needed from me, it was pointless to ask those other questions. My faith would be enough. It has been ever since.

### Pastor Ken

Ken was a fountain of knowledge for me. At first, I tested him (I admit). Did he have all this knowledge in his head? Was it book knowledge? Was it faith? He has the cummulative knowledge of all his predecessors, countless hours of study, reading the Bible, and prayer with God. 

I came to know this after already studing under other instructors. In hindsight, it was wise to take formal classes prior to studying with Pastor Ken. Actually, Pastor Ken tutored me a little and provided me with extra literature while I was taking classes. He supported me and nurtured my growth in ways I could not comprehend. His existence in my life was not completely happenstance, but I can see the purpose. He was not a random fixture in my life. He was put there or rather put in my way. I was not the first of my kind to him. I was not the last. He knew exactly what was needed as though he had been practicing it his entire life.

There is no end to what I can learn from him, but there was an end to how long the training wheels would stay on and the real work would begin. In that moment, he sat me down and would attempt to witness to me one last time. By the end, he gave me the option to pray a "Sinner's Prayer" with him. It was optional and at this point praying was no big deal because I had prayed with others. The question was now, was I willing to admit it to myself and to Ken that my life needed this one last change to become complete. I needed to accept Jesus as my savior. That impact this would have overwhelmed me. I could not do it. Then, a resolve came over me. The faith I had mentioned before that would give me the resolve to do what was necessary for God and for myself. This needed to be done. 

> **[Ephesians 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2:8&version=ESV)** For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God

Now was the time. From that point forward Pastor Ken looked at me differently. I looked at myself differently. Now our study sessions would be real Bible studies. Now He would teach me about being a Christian.


### Acceptance and My Purpose Understood

> **[Romans 12:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A1-2&version=ESV)** I appeal to you therefore, brothers,[a] by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.[b] 2 Do not be conformed to this world,[c] but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

That is nice, but what is it? What is the "good and acceptable and perfect" "will of God"? At least, what is it for me? This implies that we are all here each for a single purpose. It is true, God has one will, but there are many paths, tasks, requisites, etc... I do not know when I will be finished, but I know what I am called. I feel it each time. It is like a spidersense. I just assume I am always working for God:

> **[Colossians 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A23&version=ESV)** Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men

There are times when I knew God expects an outcome from me. In those moments, I knew His will for me.
