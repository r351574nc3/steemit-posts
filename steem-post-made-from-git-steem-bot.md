# This Post Was Created by the Docker git-steem-bot

Well, it didn't write or dictate the post. I am writing the post; however, the bot did post this to STEEM.

I created this post using a markdown editor and committed it to my [Github Steemit Posts Repository](https://github.com/r351574nc3/steemit-posts/blob/master/effing-better-auth-with-oauth2-for-elk.md) using `git`.

The bot then posted the contents to steemit.
